# What Was Pear-nt?
Pear-nt wasn't my first attempt at making a T3 app with Clerk and Upload Thing. Was fun to learn about these tools. Ultimately decided to do a rewrite when I decided to add more features. This allowed me to rethink some of my db structure / how I wan't to organize core logic. You can see the improvements I have made in Portal-Thing.
